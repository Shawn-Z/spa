				<h2>About Us</h2>
				<section>
                    <p><b>Biography of Suki Zhao</b></p> 
                    <p>Suki Zhao, CMT, has been practicing massage therapy for 
                    ten years.&nbsp; Suki is a well-known local expert in deep tissue work and sports massage.&nbsp; 
                    She is looking forward to serving the Fremont area from her serene 
                    surroundings at Serenity Day Spa of Fremont.&nbsp; </p>
                    <p>All masseuses at Serenity Day Spa of Fremont are state-
                    certified massage or facial technicians and are bilingual (English and 
                    Mandarin).</p>

                    <p><b>History of Massage Therapy</b></p>
                    <p>The practice of massage therapy is over 3000 years old.&nbsp; As 
                    far back as 1000 BC the Chinese were using some form of massage to treat 
                    paralysis or poor circulation.&nbsp; In 460-375 BC, Hippocrates, the father of modern 
                    day medicine, mentioned that "gently rubbing" of a dislocated shoulder helped in 
                    healing.&nbsp; The Greeks also used a form of massage in ancient times to prepare 
                    athletes for competition since massage was thought to improve circulation and 
                    rid the muscles of metabolites after an athletic competition.</p>
                    <p>Per Ling of Sweden popularized massage therapy in the 19<sup>th</sup> 
                    century in Stockholm, hence arising the modern day term "Swedish massage."&nbsp; 
                    In 1917 after World War I, the surgeon-general created 
                    rehabilitation programs for wounded soldiers hence massage therapy was born 
                    formally in the United States.</p>
                    <p>Simply defined, massage therapy is the manipulation of soft 
                    tissues (muscle, skin, tendons, and ligaments etc.) and the joints of the body 
                    using the hands.&nbsp; Massage therapy has many therapeutic benefits.&nbsp; The muscular, 
                    nervous, lymphatic and circulatory systems are influenced directly by the 
                    physical movements utilized in massage therapy, not to mention the tremendous 
                    benefit of mental relaxation and the reduction in stress experienced during and 
                    after a massage.</p>

                 <h2>FAQS</h2>
                 <section>
                    <p><b>What should I wear to my massage appointment?</b></p>
                    <p>Wear comfortable clothing. Depending on the treatment you choose, you may or 
                    may not need to completely disrobe. Your massage therapist will give you privacy 
                    to undress, and you will be covered with sheets or towels during your treatment.</p>
                    <p><b>What are your payment policies?</b></p>
                    <p>We accept payment by cash or credit card (Visa or MasterCard). Local 
                    regulations require that patrons pay at the time of service. If you would like 
                    to tip your massage therapist, you are welcome to do so at the end of your 
                    treatment session.</p>
                    <p><b>Are your massage oils hypoallergenic?</b></p>
                    <p>All of the materials we use are designed to minimize allergic reactions.&nbsp; 
                    If you are highly sensitive, we would be happy to test these items on a small 
                    patch of skin first, to ensure your comfort. </p>
                    <p><b>What do I do during a massage therapy treatment?</b></p>
                    <p>Make yourself comfortable. This is a time for you to relax. If your therapist 
                    requires you to be in a specific position, she will let you know.</p>
